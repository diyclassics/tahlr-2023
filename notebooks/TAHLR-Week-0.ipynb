    "- TLDR; \"SHIFT + ENTER/RETURN\" will do pretty much everything you will need to do for the demo.\n",
    "- Look for the word \"# Imports\" below and click anywhere is its surrounding box to activate that input cell. These cells are where you will find the code that we will run in today's demo.\n",
    "- If you press \"SHIFT + ENTER/RETURN\", you will *run* that cell and the output will appear in space below the cell; you will also advance to the next cell. If you press \"CTRL + ENTER/RETURN\", you will run the cell without advancing. If you press \"OPTION (or ALT) + ENTER/RETURN\", you will run the cell and insert a new empty cell below the running cell.\n",
    "- Note the brackets on the left side of the cells. If empty—that is, if there is blank space between the cells—the cell has not yet been run. If there is a number between the brackets, this is an indicator that the cell has been run and denotes the order in which the cells have been run."
